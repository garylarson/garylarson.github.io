<p>This post explains how I set up my <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> blog (with the Whiteplain theme) to get the type of syntax highlighting I want for data science / statistics purposes. I relied heavily on <a href="https://amber.rbind.io/blog/2017/11/15/syntax-highlighting/">this post</a> from Amber Thomas. Thanks a lot Amber! If I were you, I&rsquo;d probably use Amber&rsquo;s more thorough post as a guide. It stands alone better than my post here.</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>Hugo comes with a built-in, default syntax highlighting system called Chroma. There is an older, non-default option called Pygments which can still be used. To help with compatibility, Chroma retains lots of Pygments&rsquo; configuration options, e.g. you can have lines like <code>pygmentsUseClasses = true</code> in your blog&rsquo;s <code>config.toml</code> file, even if you&rsquo;re using the default Chroma instead of Pygments.  See <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/">Hugo&rsquo;s page on syntax highlighting</a> for more info.</p>

<p>The default Chroma setup didn&rsquo;t look good. For one, inline code blocks (as well as larger code chunks) showed as black font on a grey background, but I wanted something more like Github inline code <code>like this</code>.</p>

<p>One can also use a javascript library called <code>highlight.js</code>, which is ultimately what I went with. This library is described <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/themes.html#the-default-theme">here</a> in Yihui Xie&rsquo;s <code>blogdown</code> book.</p>

<p>The exact procedure to modify default syntax highlighting to suit your needs will depend on the theme you&rsquo;re using. This post relates to Whiteplain.</p>

<h1 id="the-problem">The problem</h1>

<p>I wanted inline code chunks <code>like this</code> to look as they do here. By default they were in black text on a gray background. Other code chunks had the same problem, but now they look much better, like this <code>R</code> chunk:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">myFunction &lt;- function(f,g,h){
    print('Hi Mom')
    return (f*g*h^2)
}
</code></pre>

<h1 id="what-i-did-to-solve-the-problem">What I did to solve the problem</h1>

<p>My problem is basically the same as Amber&rsquo;s, and I solved it with only minor differences to her solution.</p>

<p>So I went with <code>highlight.js</code>, not Chroma. I followed Amber&rsquo;s <strong>Step One</strong> section exactly. Here&rsquo;s the relevant code in my <code>config.toml</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[params]
  ### SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING using highlight.js
      description = &quot;A website built through Hugo and blogdown.&quot;

      highlightjsVersion = &quot;9.11.0&quot;
      highlightjsCDN = &quot;//cdn.bootcss.com&quot;
      highlightjsLang = [&quot;r&quot;, &quot;yaml&quot;, &quot;tex&quot;]
      highlightjsTheme = &quot;github&quot;

      MathJaxCDN = &quot;//cdn.bootcss.com&quot;
      MathJaxVersion = &quot;2.7.1&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>I followed her <strong>Step Two</strong> exactly as well, except where she states that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the partials folder for your theme (themes/<em>name-of-your-theme</em>/layouts/partials), you should see a file called <code>head.html</code> or <code>header.html</code>. Add the following code&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually had both files, so I added the specified code to both files, and that seemed to be fine. Now I&rsquo;m up to her <strong>Step Three</strong>, and I ignored some of her steps there. At this point my syntax highlighting for code chunks was good, but the font size was a little small and inline code <code>like this</code> still was black on a grey background. To remedy this, I right clicked on my page and clicked &ldquo;Inspect&rdquo; (using Google Chrome here) to open Developer Tools. Then I clicked the little mouse-cursor-in-a-box icon towards the left of the screen, and then found a black-on-gray inline code bit on the page and clicked on that. I followed Amber&rsquo;s advice about removing <code>pre</code> and <code>code</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Search that doc for any instances of pre or code and find the chunk that has the background-color and text color that your theme is currently generating displaying.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="inline-code-formatting-still-wasn-t-working">Inline code formatting still wasn&rsquo;t working</h2>

<p>I can&rsquo;t fully remember, but at this point I believe the syntax highlighting for inline still didn&rsquo;t work. I wanted mine to look like Amber&rsquo;s - so how was Amber&rsquo;s formatted? To find out, I simply used the Inspector on Amber&rsquo;s own page, Inspecting an inline code chunk of hers. Here the Inspector is showing how the word <code>bootstrap</code> gets its syntax highlighting:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018-08-22.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I copied the block in the lower right pane which begins with <code>code {</code> and pasted that into <code>themes/whiteplain/static/css/style.css</code>, which is apparently the <code>.css</code> file that controls inline-code syntax highlighting in the Whiteplain theme. Finally I modified <code>font-size: 90%</code> to 120% to get the code to pop a little more.</p>

<h1 id="regarding-hugo-s-lookup-order">Regarding Hugo&rsquo;s lookup order</h1>

<p>When Hugo builds your site, it looks for necessary files by searching directories in a certain order. Just above, I said I pasted code needed for inline formatting into <code>themes/whiteplain/static/css/style.css</code>. My understanding is that you ought to be able to copy the theme&rsquo;s original <code>style.css</code> file into <code>static/css/</code> and then modify <em>that</em> copy by pasting the formatting info in. In other words, my understanding is it&rsquo;s possible to leave the <code>themes/</code> directory itself alone, and <em>effectively</em> modify the theme via other files which override the default theme elements. Practically speaking this doesn&rsquo;t matter a ton. But the advantage (if I <em>had</em> done that, and if it had worked) would be that if I wanted to know if any parts of the theme are modified, I could just look in the relevant non-<code>themes/</code> directories of my site&rsquo;s folder, to see where I&rsquo;d placed overriding files. Oh well, for now, I&rsquo;ve just modified the theme&rsquo;s files in place, and it got me what I wanted, so I&rsquo;m done.</p>

<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s not described above, but initially I was using Chroma and getting things <em>almost</em> right. I had two main problems. First, code chunks had zero indentation, so when they were on a colored background, the actual code was pushed all the way to the left of that colored background. This looked weird. I probably could have solved this using the Developer Tools, but I hadn&rsquo;t yet found Amber&rsquo;s blog so Chrome&rsquo;s Developer Tools wasn&rsquo;t on my mind yet. The second problem kind of fixed the first: I added line numbers. This made for nice indentation in multi-line chunks, but for single-line chunks, I got a line number of <code>1</code> at left, which looked like clutter to me, <em>and</em> no space appeared between the <code>1</code> and the code. Inline formatting was also that ugly black on gray, but I now believe that was sort of independent of the choice of Chroma over <code>highlight.js</code> &ndash; I probably could have solved the inline problem the same way I did above.</p>

<p>Anyway, switching to <code>highlight.js</code> from the default Chroma syntax highlighter solved my code chunk problems, and Chrome&rsquo;s Developer Tools helped me quickly fix the inline code formatting. Thanks a lot Amber Thomas!</p>
