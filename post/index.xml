      <description>Linear and Polynomial Regression Here&amp;rsquo;s some cool initial code from page 284 (under &amp;ldquo;Derived Features&amp;rdquo; in the section on Feature Engineering) in the Python Data Science Handbook (PDSH). This code will allow me to quickly fit a linear and polynomial regression to very simple data. My comments are marked something like ### GJL::
% matplotlib inline import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5]) y = np.</description>

      <title>Python: single underscores vs. double underscores</title>

      <description>This Youtube video is a really great 6 minute demonstration of the distinction between _ and __. I&amp;rsquo;ll embed the linked video at the end of this post. One of the top comments on that video says
 For C++ people, foo is public, _bar is protected, and __baz is private.
 Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple class, with an initializer implemented, including the three variables foo, _bar, and __baz.
class Test: def __init__(self): self.</description>

      <title>Syntax highlighting for a Hugo data science blog</title>

      <description>This post explains how I set up my Hugo blog (with the Whiteplain theme) to get the type of syntax highlighting I want for data science / statistics purposes. I relied heavily on this post from Amber Thomas. Thanks a lot Amber! If I were you, I&amp;rsquo;d probably use Amber&amp;rsquo;s more thorough post as a guide. It stands alone better than my post here.
Background Hugo comes with a built-in, default syntax highlighting system called Chroma.</description>

      <title>Blogging with runnable Python in Rmarkdown files</title>

      <description>I wondered if I could blog with runnable Python code chunks if I&amp;rsquo;m creating my Hugo content with .Rmarkdown files. It looks like I can with the reticulate package; see the vignette here.
install.packages(&#39;reticulate&#39;, repos=&amp;quot;https://cloud.r-project.org&amp;quot;) library(reticulate)  I believe this allows you to actually run Python. Alternatively, if you just want to display Python code, just use a code fence, i.e. the Github-style code block that&amp;rsquo;s 3 backticks, new line, code, then three closing backticks on a new line, like so:</description>

      <description>Being a subscriber on Flickr to Duke University Archive&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Duke Yearlook&amp;rdquo; photostream, some pretty cool stuff comes up on my home page at Flickr. Today I learned about the 1969 takeover of the Allen Building, which is today (and presumably was then, too) an epicenter for the University administration. Apparently black students on campus were tired of the University dragging their feet &amp;ndash; tired of going through the so-called &amp;ldquo;proper channels&amp;rdquo; for over 2.</description>

      <title>David Draperâ€™s personal statement</title>

      <description>I was browsing around tonight on the topic of Bayesian model averaging. I stumbled on David Draper&amp;rsquo;s website where he posts a document called &amp;ldquo;Personal Statement&amp;rdquo; which he wrote in support of him getting a &amp;ldquo;merit increase&amp;rdquo; (i.e. a raise). Here&amp;rsquo;s the link, and in case the link dies, here&amp;rsquo;s the document.
Section 3 is great reading. He first gives a clear summary of frequentist vs. Bayesian stats, then goes on to give a little of his philosophy and biography.</description>

      <title>Objective Bayes - Day 1</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m taking a course by Jim Berger on Objective Bayesian Analysis. It begins with the motivation and history behind 250 years of objective Bayesian analysis, and today he shared an interesting tidbit.
It won&amp;rsquo;t be published publicly on my blog (yet) because Jim mentioned it could be an interesting reveal at Duke Statistical Science&amp;rsquo;s upcoming conference celebrating the 250 year anniversary of the publishing of Bayes&amp;rsquo; Theorem.
Statistician / statistics historian Stephen Stigler was wondering why Bayes was interested in the problem which led to the 1763 paper.</description>

      <description>To write a new post (like this one) using blogdown in RStudio, just click &amp;ldquo;Addins&amp;rdquo; -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;New Post&amp;rdquo; near the top of the RStudio window.
Here&amp;rsquo;s some junk R code. In the chunk options, just set eval=FALSE.
plot(x)  I should get used to writing (R) markdown pretty quickly, after translating a few of my plot posts.
Just for fun, here&amp;rsquo;s a plot.
plot(x &amp;lt;- seq(-10,10,length.out=100), sin(x), type=&#39;l&#39;, xlab=&#39;x&#39;, ylab=&#39;sin(x)&#39;)  Syntax highlighting At time of writing, I&amp;rsquo;m still having problems with syntax highlighting.</description>
